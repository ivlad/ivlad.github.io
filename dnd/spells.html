    <strong>Approach.</strong> The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you. <br>
    <strong>Drop</strong>. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn. <br>
    <strong>Flee</strong>. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means. <br>
    <strong>Grovel</strong>. The target falls prone and then ends its turn. <br>

    You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people.

    This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends.

    Casting Time: 1 action <br>
    Range: 60 feet <br>
    Duration: 10 minutes<br>
    <br>
    You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw. <br>
    An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
